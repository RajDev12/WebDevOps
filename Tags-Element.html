    <h2>HTML Element Syntax</h2>
    <p>An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document.</p>

    <p>Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag), with content in between. Elements can also contain attributes that define its additional properties. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the p element, would be written as:</p>

  <div>
    <img src="/images/html-element.png" alt="Element syntax image">

  </div>
  <b>THis is bold</b>
 
  <p>We will learn about the HTML attributes in the <a href="html-102.html" target="_blank">next chapter</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>All elements don't require the end tag or closing tag to be present. These are referred as empty elements, self-closing elements or void elements.</p>
<h2>HTML Tags Vs Elements</h2>
<p>Technically, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag and everything in between. On the other hand an HTML tag (either opening or closing) is used to mark the start or end of an element, as you can see in the above illustration.</p>
<p>However, in common usage the terms HTML element and HTML tag are interchangeable i.e. a tag is an element is a tag. For simplicity's sake of this website, the terms "tag" and "element" are used to mean the same thing â€” as it will define something on your web page</p>
